### Track C: Satellite altimetry (CLS toolchain training)

**T3.5 Altimetry competence transfer (Lead: CLS; NTUA main beneficiary; support: GFZ/TUG as needed)**

* structured onboarding to CLS tools/concepts (QC, corrections, multi-mission logic)
* NTUA reproduces a defined processing/validation chain independently

**T3.6 Mobility programme (cross-cutting)**

* staff exchanges: PhDs/postdocs/research engineers + (importantly) 1–2 research support staff visits (ties into WP5 too)
* inbound expert visits to NTUA (hands-on clinics)

**Key deliverables**

* D3.1 POD upgrade package + validation report
* D3.2 Gravimetry FOSS v1.0 + benchmark suite + documentation

## WP4 — Joint Outputs, Community Integration & Stakeholder Uptake (Lead: NTUA; co-leads per task)

**Goal:** turn capacity into **peer recognition, services, collaborations, and follow-on proposals**.

**T4.1 Joint publications & conference strategy (Lead: NTUA; all)**

* publication plan (targets, lead authorship rotation, internal review)
* conference plan: sessions, invited talks, joint presentations

**T4.2 “Service-track” outputs (analysis centre ambitions) (Lead: NTUA)**

* staged pathway toward IDS / EPN/EUREF-type service roles:

  * pilot products → trial submissions → (conditional) formal application/onboarding
* keep the last step explicitly conditional on acceptance

**T4.3 Stakeholder/User Board + engagement actions (Lead: NTUA; CLS strong role)**

* stakeholder mapping + engagement plan
* 2 stakeholder forums + 1 matchmaking/B2B-style event
* aim for **LoIs/MoUs** and at least one “service pilot” use-case (process you control)

**T4.4 Joint grant pipeline (Lead: NTUA; partners as reviewers)**

* concept-note factory: 4–6 seeds → 2–3 mature submissions by end
* mock evaluation panels run by partners

**Key deliverables**

* D4.1 Publication & conference plan + yearly updates
* D4.2 Trial service products + service-readiness report
* D4.3 Stakeholder engagement plan + outcomes report (MoUs/LoIs)

# A simple way to keep this “evaluator-proof”

Add 1 page in your notes (later in proposal) that lists:

* **3 Working Groups** (POD/Grav/Alt) → each has 2–3 flagship outputs + KPIs
* Each flagship output links to **WP3 (build capacity)** + **WP4 (publish/service)** + **WP6 (disseminate)**
