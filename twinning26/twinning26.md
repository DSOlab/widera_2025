# [Topic description](https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/HORIZON-WIDERA-2026-02-WIDENING-01?order=ASC&pageNumber=1&pageSize=50&sortBy=deadlineDate&keywords=twinning&isExactMatch=true&status=31094501,31094502)

## Part A - Expected Outcome:

>Twinning actions aim to enhance networking activities between the research institutions and research infrastructures of the Widening countries acting as co-ordinators by linking it with at least two internationally leading research institutions from two different Member States or Associated Countries. Twinning actions intend to raise the research profile of the institution from the Widening country and its staff, including strengthening the research management capacity.

CLS could be a problem here: AI states: *a great addition—but mainly as a non-academic/industry-facing impact partner (collaboration agreements, services, uptake, innovation indicators), rather than the “internationally leading research institution / higher education establishment” the paragraph is emphasising.*

**Option A (most straightforward): CLS as a beneficiary (funded)**
For CSAs, applications may be submitted by one or more legal entities (i.e., there’s no generic ban on adding a company as a partner). How to frame it (so evaluators don’t think you missed the point):
Write the “twinning core” as NTUA + GFZ + TU Graz = the internationally leading research institutions delivering the excellence/networking lift and Write CLS as “industry/uptake & valorisation partner” strengthening impact, intersectoral mobility, and innovation indicators.

**Option B: CLS as “beneficiary with zero funding” or as an “associated partner” (unfunded)**
The Work Programme explicitly allows JRC to participate either as a beneficiary with zero funding or as an associated partner in Twinning.

CLS’s tasks should be tightly tied to:
- intersectoral mobility,
- valorisation/IPR/industry collaboration deliverables,
- and the proposal’s quantitative impact indicators.

>Proposals are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
>
> - Improved research excellence and capacities in Widening countries closing the research and innovation gap within the European Union;
> - Enhanced strategic collaboration between the research institutions or higher education establishments of the Widening countries and at least two internationally leading research institutions or higher education establishments at European Union level;
> - Raised reputation, research profile and attractiveness of the coordinating institution, and improved research profile of its staff;
> - Strengthened research management capacities of the coordinating institution;
> - Development of novel approaches in R&I collaboration with increased mobility (inwards and outwards) of researchers.

## Part B - Scope:

> Twinning proposals should clearly outline the strategy for stepping up and stimulating scientific excellence and innovation capacity in a defined area of research and innovation as well as the scientific excellence of the partners involved. This strategy should include arrangements for formulating joint research and innovation activities and projects in the scientific area of choice and describe how Twinning will take this research to a new level.

### defined area of research and innovation

*We probably need CLS for altimetry, ... could GFZ do that?*

Should we add `quantum` stuff? *We will additionally develop a roadmap and targeted trainings on emerging quantum-enabled geodesy (quantum gravimetry, relativistic geodesy with optical clocks) to prepare NTUA for next-generation gravity and reference-system concepts, complementing classical satellite gravimetry and POD rather than replacing them.*

**Core**: space-geodetic Earth observation of mass + sea-level change; Space-geodetic Earth observation for quantifying time-variable mass change and sea-level variability, combining satellite gravimetry, satellite altimetry, and high-precision orbit determination (POD) as the common methodological backbone.

### strategy for stepping up and stimulating scientific excellence and innovation capacity

**Core ambition**: NTUA exits as a credible, internationally networked node that can independently deliver top-tier science + competitive proposals in POD, satellite gravimetry, satellite altimetry (and the multi-tech context: GNSS/SLR/DORIS), supported by reproducible workflows and a trained team.

#### Pillar A — Hands-on method & tool transfer (scientific excellence)

* **Three technical tracks:**

  1. **Multi-tech POD** (GNSS/SLR/DORIS)
  2. **Satellite gravimetry / gravity field recovery** (processing chain, validation, uncertainty, geophysical interpretation)
  3. **Altimetry** (multi-mission processing concepts, corrections, cross-cal, products → sea-level indicators)
* **Training-by-doing model**: staff exchanges + embedded “pair-programming / pair-analysis” weeks, code sprints, and “bring your own dataset” clinics.
* **Two paths for software capability**:

  * *Adopt & master partner toolchains* (e.g., workflow transfer, best practices, QA)
  * *Build NTUA-owned modules* 

(This “staff exchanges + training + pooling infrastructure + stakeholder co-design” pattern is very typical in strong Twinning implementations.) ([CORDIS][B01]).

The core capacity gain will come from establishing enabling scientific technology at NTUA: upgraded multi-tech POD capability, an NTUA-owned open-source gravimetry engine, and operational competence in state-of-the-art altimetry toolchains. Training is embedded in co-development and benchmarking, so NTUA shifts from “user of methods” to developer/maintainer of the tools that generate frontier results.

... or ...

This Twinning is designed to convert partner excellence into permanent, ownable capacity at NTUA: not only know-how, but validated software assets and engineering practices that allow NTUA to repeatedly produce cutting-edge results after the project. Hands-on exchanges are organised around “build/extend/verify” cycles that end with functioning capabilities running at NTUA.

### Pillar B — Joint science production (research profile)

* **Co-writing papers** with a deliberate plan (targets, lead authorship rotation, internal deadlines, pre-submission reviews).
* **Joint symposia / special sessions** at major conferences + co-presentations (and ensure NTUA leads at least some).
* ~~**Editorial / publication support mechanisms** (seen in one Twinning: partners supported visibility via editorial work and a special issue). ([CORDIS][B02])~~
* **Shared “annual scientific agenda” meeting**: agree the year’s 2–3 flagship technical questions + datasets + publication targets.

### Pillar C — Talent pipeline (ESRs/PhDs/postdocs)

* **PhD committees / co-supervision**: external committee members; optionally cotutelle-style arrangements where feasible.
* **ESR-focused package** (common Twinning structure): summer schools + mobility + mentoring built specifically around ESR needs. ([CORDIS][B03])
* **Short secondments** for ESRs/postdocs with concrete outputs (a reproducible notebook, a validation report, a draft manuscript section).
* **Visiting scientist scheme at NTUA**: 1–2 “anchor visits” per year (short, intensive), plus remote clinics.

ESR = Early-Stage Researcher.

### Pillar D — Networks & institutional positioning

* Help NTUA become active in the “right rooms”:

  * **Geodesy services / associations**: IAG + GGOS; the IAG services around techniques (IGS, ILRS, IDS, IVS, IERS as relevant to your technical mix).
  * ~~**Altimetry community**: engage with established altimetry science/validation communities and working groups (CLS can open doors here).~~
* Concrete outputs: MoUs, working arrangements, contributions to products/analysis centres where realistic (even small contributions count if well framed).

### Pillar E — Proposal engine (innovation capacity via competitiveness)

* Set up a **joint grant pipeline** (another very common “successful Twinning” move): identify 3–5 target calls, define “proposal seeds,” assign writing leads, run internal mock reviews. ([CORDIS][B01])
* Make “post-project continuity” real: at least **2 submitted proposals** by the end (one EU-level, one ESA/national/other), plus a longer-term roadmap.

Notes:
A **joint grant pipeline** is simply an organised, recurring process where the consortium systematically turns collaboration into follow-on proposals, instead of “we should apply for stuff someday.”

In practical terms:
- maintain a shared list of target calls (Horizon Europe, ESA, national, etc.) with deadlines,
- define 2–5 “proposal seeds” (short concept notes: topic + consortium + novelty + workplan sketch),
- assign a writing lead + reviewer(s) per seed,
- run internal mock evaluation (partners review each other),
- aim for at least X submissions by month 30–36.

### Pillar F — Research management capacity (enabler WP / task)

* Dedicated WP/task to **upgrade NTUA’s research management** (competence-based training, templates, grant ops, budgeting, risk, IP/data, exploitation, comms), and **standing up/strengthening a small RM team** inside NTUA (explicit deliverable).
* Include “upscaling” actions: train-the-trainer workshops so practices spread beyond the immediate lab (also seen in Twinning reporting). ([CORDIS][B02])

### Pillar G — Stakeholder & non-academic relevance (CLS sweet spot)

* User/stakeholder engagement: requirements workshops, “industry challenge day,” joint demos (even in a CSA, these are framed as *capacity + uptake*, not product development).
* Translate science into **service-oriented outputs** (validation reports, uncertainty specs, demonstrator notebooks), which supports the call’s emphasis on non-academic collaboration indicators. ([CORDIS][B04])

### Pillar H — Sustainability (explicit post-project plan)

* A **3-year roadmap beyond the grant**: staffing plan, course offerings, target networks, proposal pipeline, and a maintenance plan for code/workflows.
* Formalise “what stays” at NTUA: repos, training materials, SOPs, agreements, RM processes.

---

## Extra “what else could go there?” ideas (often used in strong Twinning)

* **Pooling infrastructure / access agreements** (formalised): shared compute access, software licences/workflows, shared datasets; this appears explicitly in at least one Twinning implementation report. ([CORDIS][B01])
* **Stakeholder co-design** as a named activity (also explicitly used). ([CORDIS][B01])
* **Open training outputs**: recorded lectures/tutorials, public notebooks, YouTube/material repositories (several Twinning projects did this). ([CORDIS][B02])
* **Gender equality actions tied to the technical programme** (mentoring, speaker balance, ESR opportunities), not just generic statements. ([CORDIS][B01])

> This should be supported by a comprehensive set of activities such as, but not limited to, short-term staff exchanges, expert visits and short term on-site or virtual trainings, workshops; conference attendance, organisation of joint summer schools, dissemination and outreach activities. As far as appropriate these activities should take into account the gender equality plans of the participants.

> Proposals should also focus on strengthening the research management capacities of the coordinating institution. This should take the form of a dedicated work package or task, placing emphasis to specific activities, in view of helping the staff of the coordinating institution to improve their broader research management capacities as defined in the European Competence Framework for Research Managers[102], including establishing/upgrading a dedicated team within the coordinating institution. This will be achieved by fully utilising the experience and best practices of the internationally leading partners and is expected to be a concrete deliverable of the Twinning exercise.

We should probably setup a (new) **RMA office** on lab/School level => should be one Task.

We should probably avoid restricting all RMA-related training/tutoring/etc to GFZ & TUG. 
Instead, we could:
* NTUA leads a School-level “RMA Cell” as the concrete deliverable (templates, SOPs, internal QA, pipeline tracker).
* GFZ/TU Graz contribute lightly but credibly (shadowing + 2–3 clinics + examples of best practice).
* National Contact Point (e.g. Praxis) + EU IP Helpdesk cover proposal-writing and IP modules (free/low-cost, highly credible).

Here are credible “mentor sources”:

**Greece-based (easy to engage, very relevant)**

---

* **EKT (National Documentation Centre) – Horizon Europe NCP**
  Good for: proposal-writing trainings, rules-of-participation clarifications, partner search support, dissemination of official guidance. ([innovation.ekt.gr][B11])

* **PRAXI Network – Horizon Europe NCP services**
  Good for: hands-on support on participation, proposal preparation, and practicalities around engagement with the programme. ([praxinetwork.gr][B12])

* **GSRI (General Secretariat for Research & Innovation)**
  Not a “trainer” in the same way, but a useful **anchor/connector** because it formalises the national NCP network and related policy initiatives (e.g., around gender equality). ([gsri.gov.gr][B13])

* **Enterprise Europe Network (EEN) Hellas**
  Good for: the “non-academic/innovation” side of research management—industry partnering, innovation support, international business/R&D matchmaking. This is useful if you want your RMA Cell to be competent in **building non-academic collaborations** (a call impact indicator). ([Enterprise Europe Network - Hellas][B14])

* **OBI (Hellenic Industrial Property Organisation) + Athens PATLIB centre (via EPO)**
  Good for: patents/prior-art searches, IP basics, and local “patent information centre” support (PATLIB). This complements the EU IP Helpdesk by giving you a **national IP anchor**. ([obi.gr][B15])

* **Γραφείο μεταφορα΄ς τεχνολογίας ΕΜΠ**
  [ΓΜΤ-ΕΜΠ](https://tto.ntua.gr/)

**EU / European-level (specialised, often free)**

---

* **Funding & Tenders Portal helpdesks + official guidance (Online Manual / AGA)**
  Good for: practical grant management questions (portal roles, reporting mechanics, amendments) and authoritative interpretation support via the portal ecosystem and guidance set. ([European Commission][B16])

* **Horizon Results Booster (free expert mentoring)**
  Good for: exploitation/dissemination/valorisation planning, “key exploitable results” thinking, go-to-market modules—very useful to professionalise your RMA Cell’s **impact/exploitation** competence. ([Booster][B17])

* **OpenAIRE (Open Science support & training)**
  Good for: Horizon Europe Open Science compliance in practice (DMP tooling, repository workflows, training services). This is an RMA competence area that many institutions underestimate. ([openaire.eu][B18])

* **Horizon Europe NCP Portal “Academy” trainings**
  Good for: structured training content (including proposal writing and lump sum sessions) you can reuse as part of your RMA training plan. ([Horizon Europe NCP Portal][B19])

* **EARMA (European Association of Research Managers and Administrators)**
  Good for: peer mentoring and professional development for research managers (mentoring schemes + academy-style training). This is a strong way to make your “RMA Cell” feel connected to **European best practice communities**. ([EARMA][B110])

**How to use these “offices” credibly in the WP**

---

* Invite them for **targeted clinics** (proposal pipeline, lump sums, exploitation/IP, open science).
* Use them for **train-the-trainer** so NTUA can internalise the competence.
* Treat them as **supporting resources** (speakers/mentors) rather than core beneficiaries, unless you want to formalise an “associated partner” role.

**Dedicated WP/task: “NTUA Research Management Cell"**

1) Set up / upgrade the team (the “concrete deliverable”)
    * Create a School-level Research Management & Administration (RMA) Cell with named roles (pre-award, post-award, comms/dissemination, data/IP support interface).
    * Define a service catalogue (what the Cell does for researchers) + internal SLAs.
    * ~~Produce a replication kit (“how another school/lab could copy this”): org chart, job descriptions, SOPs, templates.~~
2) RM Comp-based skills gap analysis + training plan
    * Run a short RM Comp self-assessment for the team + key lab staff; identify gaps (e.g., budgeting, risk, IPR, stakeholder engagement).
    * Turn it into an RMA Training Plan with levels (foundational → intermediate), and a train-the-trainer element.
3) Partner “shadowing” and expert clinics (best practice transfer)
    * Staff exchanges for administrators/research managers (not only scientists): short visits to GFZ/TU Graz research support offices to shadow:
        - proposal development processes,
        - budget building,
        - grant agreement / amendments,
        - reporting rhythms, internal QA.
    * Monthly “expert clinic” calls: 60–90 min with partner RMA leads on one theme (e.g., audits, ethics, lump sums, subcontracting).
4) Proposal preparation system (pre-award)
    * Build an internal funding intelligence routine: who scans which calls, how opportunities are shared, decision gates.
    * Create a proposal writing pipeline: concept note template → internal review → partner mock evaluation → submission pack checklist.
    * Maintain a pipeline tracker (simple dashboard): leads, deadlines, readiness, partner commitments.
5) Project implementation system (post-award)
    * Create a Project Handbook / Quality Manual template for NTUA-led EU projects: governance, decision-making, deliverables QA, risk register, internal reporting calendar.
      - Many projects formalise deliverable peer review and monthly monitoring in their handbooks.
6) Financial / legal / procurement readiness (very “real-world”)
    * Training + SOPs for:
        - budgeting and cost eligibility logic,
        - procurement/subcontracting planning (avoid delays),
        - internal approvals routing,
        - cashflow planning.
    * Run a mock audit / mock periodic report exercise once per year.
7) Open Science, data, ethics, and IPR interfaces
    * DMP templates + internal review route; “what good looks like” examples.
    * Ethics checklist and escalation route.
    * An IPR/valorisation mini-playbook (esp. relevant if you build NTUA-owned FOSS in gravimetry).
    * Interface with any existing NTUA tech transfer/legal office (even if your Cell is school-level, you can define the handoff points).
8) Stakeholder engagement + communication routines
    * Stakeholder mapping template; dissemination planning; event playbook.
    * A simple “impact evidence log” to capture indicators the call asks for (collaboration agreements, investments, IP, products/services, etc.). (The topic explicitly asks you to track these kinds of indicators.)

> A research and innovation component not exceeding 30% of the total Horizon Europe grant (including the indirect costs) may be included, which should be presented in a dedicated workpackage (WP1) entitled ‘Research component’. At least 50% of the budget for this component should be allocated to the coordinator. A research and innovation component involves the development and implementation of new ideas, methods, or technologies and advances the current state of the art in a particular field by pushing the boundaries of knowledge and creating novel solutions. All training related to research and innovation that advances beyond the state of the art should be budgeted and included in this work package.

Probably no need for that!

> The proposals should illustrate quantitatively and qualitatively the expected impact of the twinning exercise within the coordinating institution (and possibly at regional/national level) based on indicators such as scientific production and peer recognition, collaboration agreements with the non-academic sector, attracting and mobilising investments from the private sector, intellectual property developed, new innovative products or services, number of international students, number of female scientists and their roles in the research institutions.

**A) Impact within NTUA (coordinator-level)**

1) Scientific production & peer recognition

    - Quantitative KPIs (examples):

        - Publications: # joint papers (and # NTUA-led), # datasets/software papers, # citations (or field-normalised metrics if you dare).
        - Conferences: # oral presentations, # invited talks, # special sessions organised/co-chaired.
        - Software/science products: # validated releases (versioned), # “reference solutions” reproduced by NTUA independently, # external users/adopters.
        - Training pipeline: # PhD dissertations supported by Twinning, # postdocs hired, # co-supervisions / committee members from partners.
        - Community standing: formal roles/participation in geodetic services and IAG/GGOS ecosystem (e.g., IDS/ILRS/IGS/IVS/IERS; IGFS for gravity services).

    - Qualitative (“peer recognition”) signals:

        - NTUA becomes co-developer (not just user) in at least one core toolchain (your FOSS gravimetry stack is perfect here).
        - NTUA starts to be seen as the “go-to” Greek group for POD / precise orbits and space-geodetic combination.

2) Collaboration agreements with the non-academic sector

    - MoU / collaboration agreement with a national agency / operator / company
    - service-level agreement (SLA) / data processing agreement
    - co-funded PhD/postdoc with an industrial stakeholder
    - joint demonstrator with an operational user
    - Stakeholder “Club” / User Forum + B2B sessions: TwiNSol-CECs created a “Club of interest” explicitly to establish interactive contacts with stakeholders and discuss collaboration pathways, including a B2B coffee break; they invited stakeholders from local/national administration, public utilities, NGOs, SMEs, and industry.
    - ~~Advisory Board that includes stakeholders~~Create a Stakeholder Advisory Board / User Board (external, unfunded) and state you will refresh membership annually (TwiNSol model).
    - Formal “research management / valorisation” training delivered by a partner’s TTO/IP office (again, no company beneficiary needed): TwiNSol ran a knowledge valorisation/IP lecture delivered by a university Technology Transfer & IP Office, under the RMA WP.
    - Run **use-case pilots** with stakeholders using public or partner-provided data so you’re not dependent on a company procurement cycle.

3) Attracting and mobilising private-sector investment
    
    - service contracts (paid orbit analysis, QA, consultancy for mission design/operations)
    - co-funded positions (industrial PhD/postdoc, sponsorship of a research engineer)
    - in-kind contributions (compute, data access) paired with a formal collaboration

4) Intellectual property developed
    
    software absolutely counts as IP

5) New innovative products or services: In your domain, “products/services” can be *operational scientific services*, not consumer products. NTUA ??gravimetry?? FOSS stack as a maintained community tool (releases + documentation + benchmarks)
    - IDS AC?
    - EUREF/EPN AC?

**B) Impact at regional/national level (optional, but you should use it)**

    - **National competence hub**: NTUA provides training and support to Greek universities/research centres and to national programme stakeholders in precise orbits / space-geodetic methods, which are underrepresented nationally (your “many can do SAR, few can do orbits” argument).
    - Support **national space/SSA goals**: align with EU SST’s operational framing (collision avoidance / re-entry / fragmentation awareness) as a national skills uplift.
    - Capacity spillover: host annual national short courses/summer schools at NTUA; open-source releases + reproducible benchmarks become a public good.
    - Use EU SST + Greek National Small Satellite Programme primarily under:
        
        - non-academic collaboration agreements, and
        - mobilisation of private-sector investment

**GitHub-style metrics as KPIs (stars/forks/downloads/MRs/issues)**

Yes — they’re legitimate, measurable KPIs and evaluators usually like them because they’re objective and align with Open Science.

Where to place them:
- Scientific production & peer recognition (my preference): treat them as community uptake / peer validation of NTUA-led scientific outputs (software + benchmarks + reproducible pipelines).
- New innovative products or services (also valid): if you frame the software as a service-enabling product (e.g., “NTUA Orbit Toolkit” + “NTUA Gravity Toolkit” that others actually adopt).

Practical KPI examples:
*public releases / versioned milestones; # Zenodo DOIs; # external contributors; # merged PRs/MRs from outside consortium; # issues opened by external users; # downloads (PyPI/Conda/Docker pulls); # forks/stars; # citations of the “software paper”*.


> The proposal should demonstrate how the leading scientific institutions in the consortium will contribute in terms of provision of access to new research avenues, creativity and the development of new approaches, as well as acting as a source for increased gender equality, inclusiveness and mobility (inwards and outwards) of qualified scientists and young researchers including doctoral candidates.

- Access to new research avenues (what NTUA couldn’t realistically do alone)
- Creativity / new approaches (what methodological leaps are unlocked)
- Gender equality + inclusiveness + mobility (what concrete mechanisms + targets)

You can treat that sentence as a **“prove the added value of the leading partners” checklist**

**1) Provision of access to new research avenues**

GFZ (Germany)

---

* **Access** to partner-grade know-how and reference solutions in **POD + gravity-field / geophysical applications**, plus exposure to how a top centre structures scientific agendas and quality assurance.
* **Access** to “hard-to-get-right” expertise: validation culture, uncertainty characterisation, and end-to-end product thinking (from observations → geodetic products → geophysical indicators).
* **Access** to networks and community positioning (co-authorship + introductions + pathways to contribute to international services).

(You can point to GFZ’s formal commitment to equality/DEI as part of the “source” role later.) ([GFZ][B21])

TU Graz (Austria)

---

* **Access** to the **GROOPS** ecosystem and the competence to run/extend it for gravity-field recovery and orbit/GNSS processing—this is a concrete “new avenue” because it enables you to do things you can’t do without an advanced toolchain. ([TU Graz][B22])
* **Access** to open-source engineering practices around a mature scientific codebase (release management, documentation/cookbook, reproducible configurations), which directly supports the “take research to a new level” ambition.

CLS (France, non-academic)

---

* **Access** to “operational altimetry thinking”: multi-mission processing, product QA, and user-facing service orientation—i.e., the bridge from research to usable outputs (very aligned with the impact indicators later in the call).
* **Access** to structured corporate DEI/CSR practices (useful as a “role model” input for inclusiveness actions). ([CLS][B23])

**2) Creativity + development of new approaches (what changes scientifically)**

A good way to frame “creativity/new approaches” is: **combination + cross-fertilisation** across techniques and cultures (academic ↔ operational).

Notes you can use:

* **Method combination as the creativity engine:** multi-tech POD (GNSS/SLR/DORIS) + gravimetry + altimetry → more integrated products/interpretations than any single-method pipeline.
* **Software and methods co-development:** not only “use partner tools”, but **co-design new modules** and benchmarks; TU Graz’s GROOPS model is a strong reference point for how to build durable scientific software capacity. ([TU Graz][B22])
* **Operationalisation as innovation:** CLS pushes you toward QC, service definitions, and user requirements—i.e., “innovation capacity” beyond papers. ([CLS][B23])

If you later want one sentence that evaluators like:

* *“New approaches emerge from combining technique-specific excellence with shared QA/uncertainty practices and by embedding an operational/service perspective into academic pipelines.”*

---

**3) Gender equality, inclusiveness, and mobility (inwards/outwards)**

A) Mobility mechanisms (be concrete)

---

* **Outbound mobility (NTUA → partners):** short secondments for PhDs/postdocs/research engineers to GFZ/TU Graz/CLS tied to defined outputs (module implemented, benchmark reproduced, draft paper section).
* **Inbound mobility (partners → NTUA):** visiting expert weeks, code sprints, on-site clinics, summer schools hosted at NTUA.
* **Hybrid/virtual mobility:** monthly research clinics + quarterly hack/analysis weeks to keep momentum and include those with care constraints.

B) Gender equality & inclusiveness actions (also concrete)

---

Use partners as “sources” by referencing that they have mature structures:

* GFZ has a formal **Gender Equality Plan** and explicit DEI strategy. ([GFZ][B21])
* TU Graz has a dedicated **Gender/Diversity/Equal Opportunity unit** and published materials on embedding gender & diversity considerations. ([TU Graz][4])
* CLS has a stated commitment to diversity (e.g., signed a diversity charter) and publishes CSR/DEI indicators. ([CLS][B23])

Then translate that into your project-level mechanisms:

* **Targets** (safe, non-overreaching): gender balance goals for mobility participants, speakers, committees; minimum share of women in ESR/PhD mobility; women in technical leadership roles (WG co-leads, demo leads).
* **Inclusive mobility design:** family-friendly scheduling, remote participation options, travel planning that avoids barriers, explicit anti-harassment / code of conduct for events.
* **Mentoring:** cross-institution mentoring pairs, including women mentors where possible; “career Q&A” sessions at summer schools.

**C) Evidence/KPIs (so it doesn’t stay generic)**

* % women among seconded researchers; % women among invited speakers/trainers; # women in leadership roles (WG leads, paper leads)
* # inbound/outbound secondments; total person-months of mobility
* # PhD committee memberships/co-supervisions across partners
* participant satisfaction surveys + qualitative testimonials on inclusiveness

**How to structure this in the proposal (notes)**

---

A simple template that usually scores well:

* **Partner contribution table** with 3 columns:

  1. *Access provided* (tools, know-how, networks)
  2. *Mechanism* (secondments, clinics, shared benchmarks, committees)
  3. *Outputs/KPIs* (papers, releases, services, mobility numbers, gender metrics)

If you want, I can draft that table **specifically** for GFZ / TU Graz / CLS / NTUA with 5–6 crisp bullets each (still “notes mode”, not final text).

Three years it is!

## AI Evaluation (Draft)

Here’s a tough-love, evaluator-style gap analysis of your current concept, with concrete additions that will most improve scores under **Excellence / Impact / Implementation**.

## Biggest risks / what you’re missing

### 1) You’re strong technically, but the *“strategy” mechanism* is still a bit implicit (Excellence)

Right now the pillars describe *what* you’ll do, but evaluators will still ask: **“How do you choose and execute joint R&I activities, year after year, and how do you ensure they lead to outputs?”**

**Add (lightweight, high value):**

* A **Joint Scientific & Innovation Agenda** process:

  * 3 Working Groups (POD / Gravimetry / Altimetry), co-led by NTUA + a leading partner
  * an annual **Agenda & Portfolio workshop** that selects **2–3 flagship “seed projects”** (paper/software/service outputs)
  * quarterly progress clinics + internal peer review of deliverables

This directly answers “arrangements for formulating joint R&I activities/projects”.

### 2) “New level” needs to be defined as a *step-change*, not “we trained a lot” (Excellence + Impact)

Your best differentiator is **tool-enabled capability** (upgrade POD; NTUA-owned gravimetry FOSS; mastery of CLS altimetry tooling). That’s great—but you must translate it into **proof-of-capacity statements**.

**Add: a benchmark ladder per track (measurable and credible)**

* POD: NTUA reproduces partner reference solution A → extends with multi-tech B → produces routine orbit solutions for a target class (e.g., LEO/GRACE-FO)
* Gravimetry: NTUA releases v1/v2/v3 of FOSS + reproduces a published benchmark + uncertainty/QC reports
* Altimetry: NTUA reproduces a defined processing/validation chain + produces a repeatable indicator product

This keeps you ambitious without “overselling”—a common Horizon pitfall flagged by REA (“don’t oversell / don’t be too ambitious”). ([European Research Executive Agency][C01])

### 3) Non-academic collaboration & private investment are currently the soft underbelly (Impact)

If you don’t want companies as beneficiaries (reasonable), the way to score well is **stakeholder governance + controlled deliverables** (things you can guarantee), not “we’ll try to collaborate”.

**What successful Twinning projects do (and you can copy structurally):**

* Create a **Stakeholder “Club of Interest”** to build interactive links and translate to contracts/services/innovation projects. ([TwiNSol-CECs][C02])
* Put stakeholders into an **Advisory Board** (unfunded) with a clear role and membership refresh process. ([TwiNSol-CECs][C03])

**Add (guarantee without overreach):**

* Deliverable: **Stakeholder mapping + engagement plan**
* Events: **2 stakeholder forums + 1 matchmaking/B2B day**
* Target: **≥1 MoU/LoI** with a non-academic entity by M24 and **≥1 service pilot** by M36
  (LoIs/MoUs are safer than promising revenue; you control the process.)

### 4) RMA WP: you have the right intent, but you need a “hard deliverable package” (Implementation + Impact)

The call is explicit: dedicated WP/task, aligned to **RM Comp**, establishing/upgrading a **dedicated team**. ([European Commission][C04])

**Common winning pattern:** set up an internal “International Research Management Office” style unit + train staff via workshops/visits. BIOLAWEB is a clean public example with a full WP focused on creating such an office and training for proposal preparation and implementation. ([biolaweb.com][C05])

**Add (make it concrete, even if only school/lab level):**

* “NTUA Research Management Cell (School-level pilot)” deliverable bundle:

  * service catalogue + SOPs/templates (pre-award, post-award, risk, QA, reporting)
  * RM Comp gap analysis + training plan
  * a replication kit (“how another NTUA unit can copy this”)
* Include at least one **lump-sum readiness** module (very practical for HE). ([European Commission][C06])

### 5) You need an explicit IPR/exploitation spine (Impact)

If you’re developing software, you should treat IP professionally and visibly.

**Add: an “IPR Protection / Exploitation Plan” deliverable early**
TwiNSol-CECs published an explicit **IPR Protection Plan** deliverable (good model). ([TwiNSol-CECs][C07])
For you, it can cover: licensing choices (FOSS), governance, contribution policy, dual-licensing possibilities, branding, and exploitation routes (services, training, support contracts).

### 6) Scope creep risk: POD + gravimetry + altimetry + national mission design

This can look **too broad for €0.8–1.5M / 3 years** unless you unify it tightly.

**Mitigation:** keep a single narrative:

* “Space-geodetic Earth observation & precise orbits for mass/sea-level change + operational orbit competence”
  …and limit “national mission design” to **one focused national impact use-case** (not a fourth technical pillar).

## Concrete additions that would materially strengthen your proposal

1. **Governance**

* Exec Board (small), Science & Innovation Board, Working Groups, Stakeholder Board (unfunded). (This makes “arrangements” real.)

2. **Flagship outputs (commit to 2–3)**

* “NTUA Gravity FOSS v1 + software paper”
* “NTUA multi-tech POD upgrade + validation report”
* “Altimetry indicator demonstrator + stakeholder pilot”

3. **KPI framework (baseline → target → evidence owner)**

* Include software uptake metrics (stars/forks/downloads/external PRs) under **peer recognition** and/or **innovative products/services**—both are defensible if you explain the logic.

4. **Service-level ambition without overpromising**

* IDS/EUREF analysis center ambitions are great as “new services”, but stage them:

  * pilot products → trial submissions → application/onboarding (conditional on acceptance)

5. **Risk management**

* Explicit risks for software development, partner availability, staff turnover, proprietary tool access (CLS), and mitigation per risk.

6. **Don’t forget the optional R&I component rules (if you use it)**

* It’s optional but must be ≤30% and (if included) structured as the required “Research component” WP and budget rules in the WP text. ([European Commission][C04])

## What you’re already strong on (keep)

* Clear Widening coordinator logic + strong “leading partners”
* A genuinely differentiated “capacity backbone” vision (tool ownership + mastery)
* Natural pathways to measurable impact (services, software, training pipeline)

If you want, next I can turn the above into a **one-page “evaluator-proof” checklist** mapped to the three criteria (what to show, where to show it, and what evidence to attach), staying in “notes mode.”
