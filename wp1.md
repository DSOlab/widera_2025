# WP1. Institutional Modernisation and Reforms

Alliance-first: all processes/tools are for Alliance/CoE operations; institutional adoption is optional (pathways only).

T1.1 = how we assess; T1.2 = how we run processes; T1.3 = how we hire/seat people to run them; T1.4 = how hubs govern.

## T1.1 Co-develop and adopt CoARA-aligned research assessment framework (MX-MX). Lead partner: NTUA; Participants: NTUA, TUC, Akdeniz + 2 EP (+SME??) 

- Scope: Design → pilot → refine the Alliance framework (narrative-CV, rubric, evidence rules/DOIs, COI/bias controls, panel training + calibration).
- Deliverables: Assessment Pack v1.0 (templates, handbook, forms), Pilot Report(s), v1.1 update.
- KPIs (safe): ≥2 internal calls run with the pack; ≥40 panelists trained; 100% decisions logged with evidence links.

### What Will We Do?
* Baseline scan: collect current assessment forms/rules from alliance partners; extract gaps vs CoARA.
* Policy pack v1.0: draft CoARA principles, Narrative-CV template, evidence rules (DOIs/dashboards), scoring rubric, COI/appeals forms.
* Panel ops kit: bias-mitigation prompts, calibration deck (3 anonymised sample CVs), decision-logging template.
* Quant metrics: define uptime/latency/accuracy/reuse indicators and how panels verify them (links to QA dashboards).
* Training: 2 micro-modules for panelists + one live calibration session per hub.
* Internal pilots: run 1–2 alliance calls (e.g., seed awards/fellowships) using the pack; log decisions & feedback.
* v1.1 update: revise pack from pilot lessons; publish “how-to” one-pagers for applicants and panelists.
* Assessment registry basics: set up COI register and decision log (read-only for audits).
* Comms kit: short guidance for applicants (Narrative-CV “dos & don’ts”) and a FAQ.
* Handover: file the Alliance Assessment Pack v1.1; describe optional institutional pathway (no obligation).

### Sample role split

* Lead widening (NTUA): own timeline, compile Policy Pack, run pilots & v1.1.
* Widening NTUA: Narrative-CV template + applicant guidance.
* Widening TUC: Panel ops kit (bias/COI forms, calibration deck).
* Widening Akdeniz: Metrics & dashboard linkage; decision-logging/COI registry.
* Non-widening X: External peer review of the pack
* Non-widening Y: Map to international practices (e.g., IAG/GGOS bodies) and sanity-check
* SME (??if needed??): polish materials, microsite for downloads, short explainer videos.


## T1.2 Establish Central Research Management and Administration (RMA) Office (MX-MX). Lead partner: NTUA; Participants: NTUA, VUGTK, Akdeniz + 1 EP (+SME??)

- Scope: Stand up/strengthen RMA nodes for Alliance work (workflows, trackers, QA of reports/audits); document institutional pathways (how a Senate/Dean could adopt—no obligation).
- Deliverables: RMA Playbook, toolchain configs, “Institutional Pathways” guide, info sessions at HEIs, 
- KPIs (safe): 1 Alliance RMA Playbook; ≥4 pathway briefings held; reporting error rate ↓ vs Y1 baseline.

### Notes
Maybe we should add something like "Institutional Pathways" to stress that the 
outcomes (products/practices/handbooks etc) will be shared with the institutions 
and we will introduce pathways for these institutions to adopt/mirror them.

### What Will We Do?
- Baseline & map: inventory current RMA processes/tools (proposal→grant→report→audit) across partners; identify gaps/bottlenecks.
- RMA Playbook v1.0: standard workflows, SOPs, checklists, and templates (budgets, timesheets/PMs, travel, procurement, deliverables, milestones).
- Tooling light-stack: configure a shared ticketing/helpline, document hub, decision register, and simple KPI board (cycle time, error rate, on-time reporting).
- Compliance packs: ready-to-use bundles for ethics/GDPR/security, COI forms, audit trail, and DMP/DPIA templates
- Service catalogue & SLOs: define RMA services (pre-award, post-award, audits) with response targets; publish to the consortium.
- Pilot & refine: run one full reporting cycle using the new workflows/tools on selected projects; capture issues; release Playbook v1.1.
- Pathways (non-binding): produce an Institutional Pathways Guide explaining how HEIs could adopt/align (governance steps, HR links, costs)—no obligation.
- Training & clinics: short micro-modules for PIs/admins; monthly RMA clinic; quick “how-to” one-pagers.
- Quality checks: quarterly mini-audits (file completeness, COI usage, GDPR controls), incident post-mortems, and remedial actions tracked.

### Sample role split

* Lead widening (NTUA): orchestrates baseline, authors Playbook, runs pilots & v1.1 update.
* Widening NTUA: Service catalogue/SLOs; decision register design.
* Widening VUGTK: Compliance packs (GDPR/ethics/security) and audit checklists.
* Widening Akdeniz: Training materials + clinics; onboarding PIs/admins.
* Non-widening X: Benchmark best-practice; review Playbook and SLOs.
* SME (opt.): Set up ticketing/KPI board; automate templates.


## T1.3 Recruit/train RMA staff and integrate into governance (MX-MX). Lead partner: NTUA; Participants: NTUA, PECNY, VUGTK   + 1 EP

Not very celar to me ..., something along the lines of ... 
RMA Workforce: Recruit • Train • Certify • Integrate.

- Scope: Fill key roles for Alliance delivery; micro-credentialled training; embed RMA leads in Boards/Committees for the project.
- Deliverables: Job packs using OTM-R wording (for project-funded posts), micro-credentials issued, integration memo.
- KPIs (safe): ≥12 staff certified; ≥90% Alliance processes handled through RMA; service catalogue with targets published.

### What Will We Do?
- Role map & headcount: define Alliance roles (pre-award officer, post-award officer, data steward, compliance/GDPR, finance, DevOps liaison), target headcount per widening HEI, and a skills matrix.
- OTM-R job packs: draft inclusive adverts (EURAXESS), scoring rubrics, COI forms, interview scripts; run transparent competitions for project-funded posts/secondments.
- Onboarding curriculum: micro-modules on budgets/reporting/audits, FAIR & DMP, GDPR/security basics, decision registers, SOPs/SLAs, and tool use (ticketing, KPI board).
- Micro-credentials & graded artifacts: assess each trainee on a graded artifact (e.g., a complete reporting file, DMP/DPIA pack, audit-ready dossier) → issue RMA micro-credentials (Pass/Merit/Distinction).
- Train-the-Trainer (TtT): prepare 1–2 RMA trainers per widening HEI; co-teach a live clinic; certify instructors.
- Integration into governance: seat RMA leads on Alliance Boards/Committees (agenda inputs, risk/issue logs); publish a service catalogue with SLOs.
- Clinics & shadowing: monthly RMA clinic; short job-shadowing rotations at a mature partner; maintain an FAQ and template library.
- Diversity & retention actions: balanced panels, flexible contracts, mentoring; track satisfaction and turnover.

### Sample role split

* Lead widening NTUA: role map, job packs, run competitions; owns certification.
* Widening NTUA: onboarding curriculum + SOP kits; runs monthly clinics.
* Widening PECNY: micro-credential rubrics; evaluates graded artifacts.
* Widening VUGTK: governance integration; service catalogue & SLOs.
* Non-widening X: host shadowing; review training content; mock audit.


## T1.4 Form interdisciplinary research clusters, with defined governance and incentives (MX-MX). Lead partner: NTUA; Participants: Cluster Leaders + 1 EP

- Scope: Charters, decision rules, interfaces to Boards; light internal incentives (mini-actions/seed support rules). No research content here.
- Deliverables: Hub Charters & Interface Map, Incentives Note.
- KPIs (safe): governance calendar in force; ≥3 cross-hub mini-actions approved via set rules.


### What Will We Do?
* Charters & roles: draft one Cluster Charter per hub (mission, scope boundaries, decision rights, EDI/COI rules, meeting cadence). Define Lead, Deputy, RMA liaison, (Data-Steward liaison, DevOps liaison -opt.), and a small Secretariat.
* Interfaces (RACI maps): formalise how each hub interacts with the Scientific Board, and all other relevant Boards & Secretiariates (inputs/outputs, approval gates).
* Annual planning & backlog intake: one road-mapping workshop per year; single Backlog Register with intake from WP3/4 and Living Labs (problem statements → hub actions).
* Mini-action scheme (incentives): rulebook for internal micro-grants / release-days. Clear criteria, sprint format, and reporting.
* Credit & recognition rules: authorship/acknowledgement guidance and CoARA-aligned contribution recording (software, datasets, SOPs, service ops) so work “counts” in Narrative CVs.
* KPI dashboard (hub view): agree a minimal set—attendance, decision lead-time, # mini-actions, cross-hub actions, % actions closed, stakeholder satisfaction (from Living Labs).
* Playbooks: short SOPs for: running a hub meeting, agreeing a mini-action, and closing the loop with Living Labs.


### Sample role split
* Hub Leads (NTUA, Akdeniz, PECNY, TUC): write Charters, chair meetings, own Backlog, propose mini-actions, co-author Playbooks, run mini-actions, maintain hub KPIs.
* Non-widening advisors (EP): sanity-check Charters & interfaces, mentor first two mini-actions, align with international services.
* RMA liaison (from T1.2): decision register, COI/EDI compliance, documentation quality.
* Data-Steward/DevOps liaisons (): ensure outputs are FAIR, reproducible, and ready for handover.
