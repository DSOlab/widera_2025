## Main (??)

Geospatial technologies, space geodesy, and Earth observation systems are at the foundation of modern digital economies. Geographic Information Systems (GIS), real-time satellite data, and advanced positioning technologies directly enable critical applications in sectors ranging from smart urban planning and precision agriculture to disaster resilience and climate-change monitoring. AETHEREUS is not “another Earth-science CoE”: it is an HEI-centred alliance that brings geodesy closer to stakeholders through operational, open, reproducible toolchains and service-ready products, turning high-precision data into actionable knowledge for public services and industry.

The economic impact of such advancements is tangible: better GIS systems facilitate optimised infrastructure planning and land-use management; advanced satellite monitoring supports logistics and supply-chain optimisation; and geospatial insights enhance natural-hazard response strategies, reducing the economic costs of climate-related disruptions. Improved satellite-based services like navigation and positioning (PNT) also strengthen Europe’s digital sovereignty and industrial competitiveness, supporting new business models in sectors such as transport, energy, and construction.

The project promotes the objectives of the European Research Area (ERA) Policy Agenda 2022–2024 and aligns with the 2025–2027 agenda, advancing assessment reform (CoARA), sustainable research careers, open science, and knowledge valorisation. Concretely, AETHEREUS delivers institutional modernisation in widening HEIs (narrative CVs, OTM-R recruitment, recognition of software/data/services), skills development (staff exchanges, train-the-trainer, micro-credentials), and digital capacity (containerised pipelines, CI/CD, FAIR data services, secure APIs, SOPs/SLAs/QA dashboards). Research is limited to validation and inter-comparison that underpins services; primary emphasis is on capacity, adoption, and uptake.

AETHEREUS complements the EU Space Programme (EUSPA) and Copernicus, supports DEP priorities on advanced digital skills and infrastructures, and adheres to INSPIRE for interoperable spatial data. Products and validation artefacts are FAIR-by-design and exposed through EOSC-compatible channels (DOIs, rich metadata, provenance). The alliance will contribute to and align with international geodesy services—GGOS, IGS/ILRS/IDS/EUREF—by supplying standards-compliant products, validation reports, and benchmark datasets, thereby strengthening Europe’s role without duplicating existing mandates.

By investing in institutional reforms, people, and digital operations—and by proving quality through open benchmarks and thresholds—AETHEREUS turns space-geodesy excellence into reliable services and living-lab pilots for climate, coastal, and geohazard use cases. This approach directly supports Europe’s Digital & Green transitions, improves public services, and builds durable capacity in widening universities to sustain cutting-edge research and innovation beyond the grant.

## Geodesy, Importance & Application Range

Space geodesy is the quiet backbone of the digital world. It provides the reference frames, precise orbits, positions and time that make GNSS (e.g., Galileo/EGNOS), Earth-observation missions, and modern mapping actually work. Those fundamentals ripple into everyday life: navigation and logistics, telecom synchronization, banking time-stamps, smart agriculture, offshore energy, construction and surveying, and autonomous systems all depend on geodetic precision. Beyond enabling productivity and growth, geodetic measurements of sea level, land motion, gravity change and water storage turn satellites into economic sensors—optimising irrigation, ports and supply chains, cutting disaster losses, and de-risking major infrastructure.

It is also a decision engine for policy. Space-geodetic products quantify ice and water mass change, subsidence and uplift, and earthquake/landslide deformation, grounding climate targets, coastal adaptation, spatial planning and civil protection in hard evidence. Europe is investing to lead this arena—through ESA Earth Explorer and Copernicus Sentinel missions, Galileo/EGNOS, and vibrant international collaborations—because sovereign, FAIR, standards-compliant geodesy underpins scientific excellence, industrial competitiveness and public safety. In short: when geodesy is strong, everything built on top—EO analytics, AI, industry services and policy—becomes more reliable, reproducible and useful.
