# Review - Excellence

## Excellence, ... but with Fucus on Satellite Geodesy

Geospatial technologies, space geodesy, and Earth observation systems are at the foundation of modern digital economies. Geographic Information Systems (GIS), real-time satellite data, and advanced positioning technologies directly enable critical applications in sectors ranging from smart urban planning and precision agriculture to disaster resilience and climate-change monitoring. AETHEREUS is not “another Earth-science CoE”: it is an HEI-centred alliance that brings geodesy closer to stakeholders through operational, open, reproducible toolchains and service-ready products, turning high-precision data into actionable knowledge for public services and industry.

The economic impact of such advancements is tangible: better GIS systems facilitate optimised infrastructure planning and land-use management; advanced satellite monitoring supports logistics and supply-chain optimisation; and geospatial insights enhance natural-hazard response strategies, reducing the economic costs of climate-related disruptions. Improved satellite-based services like navigation and positioning (PNT) also strengthen Europe’s digital sovereignty and industrial competitiveness, supporting new business models in sectors such as transport, energy, and construction.

The project promotes the objectives of the European Research Area (ERA) Policy Agenda 2022–2024 and aligns with the 2025–2027 agenda, advancing assessment reform (CoARA), sustainable research careers, open science, and knowledge valorisation. Concretely, AETHEREUS delivers institutional modernisation in widening HEIs (narrative CVs, OTM-R recruitment, recognition of software/data/services), skills development (staff exchanges, train-the-trainer, micro-credentials), and digital capacity (containerised pipelines, CI/CD, FAIR data services, secure APIs, SOPs/SLAs/QA dashboards). Research is limited to validation and inter-comparison that underpins services; primary emphasis is on capacity, adoption, and uptake.

AETHEREUS complements the EU Space Programme (EUSPA) and Copernicus, supports DEP priorities on advanced digital skills and infrastructures, and adheres to INSPIRE for interoperable spatial data. Products and validation artefacts are FAIR-by-design and exposed through EOSC-compatible channels (DOIs, rich metadata, provenance). The alliance will contribute to and align with international geodesy services—GGOS, IGS/ILRS/IDS/EUREF—by supplying standards-compliant products, validation reports, and benchmark datasets, thereby strengthening Europe’s role without duplicating existing mandates.

By investing in institutional reforms, people, and digital operations—and by proving quality through open benchmarks and thresholds—AETHEREUS turns space-geodesy excellence into reliable services and living-lab pilots for climate, coastal, and geohazard use cases. This approach directly supports Europe’s Digital & Green transitions, improves public services, and builds durable capacity in widening universities to sustain cutting-edge research and innovation beyond the grant.

## Satellite Geodesy, Importance & Application Range

Space geodesy is the quiet backbone of the digital world. It provides the reference frames, precise orbits, positions and time that make GNSS (e.g., Galileo/EGNOS), Earth-observation missions, and modern mapping actually work. Those fundamentals ripple into everyday life: navigation and logistics, telecom synchronization, banking time-stamps, smart agriculture, offshore energy, construction and surveying, and autonomous systems all depend on geodetic precision. Beyond enabling productivity and growth, geodetic measurements of sea level, land motion, gravity change and water storage turn satellites into economic sensors—optimising irrigation, ports and supply chains, cutting disaster losses, and de-risking major infrastructure.

It is also a decision engine for policy. Space-geodetic products quantify ice and water mass change, subsidence and uplift, and earthquake/landslide deformation, grounding climate targets, coastal adaptation, spatial planning and civil protection in hard evidence. Europe is investing to lead this arena—through ESA Earth Explorer and Copernicus Sentinel missions, Galileo/EGNOS, and vibrant international collaborations—because sovereign, FAIR, standards-compliant geodesy underpins scientific excellence, industrial competitiveness and public safety. In short: when geodesy is strong, everything built on top—EO analytics, AI, industry services and policy—becomes more reliable, reproducible and useful.


## Geodesy Crisis -  A Global Problem

*Maybe we could mention/target the Geodesy Crisis* which boils down to:
- Declining Number of Geodesy Programs and Graduates
- Aging Workforce and Lack of Replacements
- Low Awareness and Visibility of Geodesy
- Competition from Other STEM Fields
- Challenges in Recruitment and Retention

We could include it in Excellence(?), with a trimmed version of the following:

There is a widely noted “geodesy workforce crisis”: the talent pipeline is shrinking 
while dependence on precise reference frames, orbits, and gravity products grows. 
Recent briefings and articles warn that shortages of trained geodesists threaten 
reliability of GNSS/PNT, EO mission cal/val, and downstream services; the issue is 
global, not just U.S., with European stakeholders also flagging capacity gaps and 
proposing coordinated MSc training and governance actions. Our alliance directly 
addresses this by building HEI-centred capacity—operational toolchains, certified skills, 
and standards participation—so Europe sustains sovereign, FAIR, service-grade geodesy for 
science, industry, and public safety. 
Analyses presented to U.S. advisory bodies detail declining academic programs and aging 
expertise, with risks to critical geospatial infrastructure; these points underscore the 
need for structured training, valida`tion, and open benchmarks that AETHEREUS will deliver.

## Alternate Version of Excellence (shorter version, 1)
Geospatial technologies, space geodesy, and Earth Observation systems are critical for addressing climate change, natural hazards, and sustainable development. The European Union has recognized their importance through the Green Deal, Digital Europe, Destination Earth, and EOSC.

In this landscape, infrastructures such as EUREF, EPOS, and Copernicus Services provide essential data and services. Yet, widening countries remain under-represented in these structures. The proposed Centre of Excellence will not duplicate but will complement and reinforce them: contributing to EUREF through regional reference frames, to EPOS with new geohazard and geodynamics data from widening countries, and to Copernicus by regionalizing EO products for local users.

The CoE strategy is built on four pillars: (1) Institutional Modernization, (2) Human Capital Empowerment, (3) Research Excellence Development, (4) Digital Transformation. Within this framework, the CoE will deliver flagship outputs such as a GNSS-based hazard early-warning system, a Coastal Altimetry Suite, and a Mass-change Processing Chain.

In this way, the CoE will act as a bridge between widening countries and European infrastructures, while producing tangible scientific and technological outputs. The NTUA will provide strategic coordination, and widening partners will assume leadership roles in research clusters, ensuring genuine and sustainable capacity building.
